Real-time sharing whiteboard with multiple users.

Notes:
We mainly focused on real-time sharing the drawings on the whiteboard. Users can create
boards and people can join them. For now, there are no private/protected boards (protected with
password or what not). The algorithm for drawing was referenced from: https://medium.com/@ssaurel/learn-to-create-a-paint-application-for-android-5b16968063f8.
Additionally, since there was no time to improve the drawing algorithm (it might have some glitches)
there was also no time to scale the drawings on different screens. This app would work pretty well
if the screens that is shared with are similar size and quality.
